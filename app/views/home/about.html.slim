        | I've explored a lot of different creative fields; from fine art, illustration, and now graphic design. Then one day, I came across product design, and fell in love. Detailed designs, engaging interactions, unique experiences… they all combined to help solve people's problems and enhance their lives. But above all, what fascinated the most about product design was how it ultimately makes people happy through a meaningful and delightful experience.

        | Since then I've been practicing product design and been living day-to-day exploring, questioning, and tackling new challenges to become a better designer – a designer who creates products that make people's day. The kid in me still enjoys drawing, so I've been practicing illustration on the side.

        | Unfortunately, I won't be accepting any work because I'll be in New York and Menlo Park for exciting internship opportunities until later this year. However, I'd still love to meet up and have a chat over coffee. With wings and beer? Even better!
